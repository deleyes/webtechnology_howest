   <p> Adenosine is a purine nucleoside composed of a molecule of adenine
attached to a ribose sugar molecule (ribofuranose) moiety via a β-N9-glycosidic
bond. Derivatives of adenosine are widely found in nature and play an
important role in biochemical processes, such as energy transfer—as adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)—as well as in signal
transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Adenosine itself is a
neuromodulator, believed to play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing
arousal. Adenosine also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various
organs through vasodilation.  </p>
