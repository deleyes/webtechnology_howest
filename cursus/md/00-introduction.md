# Introduction

The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to dynamic webpages (HTML,
CSS) powered by PHP.

During this course the student will learn how to create a static HTML webpage
styled by CSS.

Finally the webpages should become dynamic powered by the PHP
programming language.

## Resources

The main documentation for this course is a site and can be found at
<https://asoete.github.io/howest-webtechnology>. The main advantage of using
a site as a textbook is that the included examples and snippets can be
rendered/formatted by the browser on the fly.

A [PDF version](pdfs/cursus.pdf) of this document is also available. But keep
in mind that some HTML features will be lost in the conversion to a pdf.

There are no slides available, all the key aspects of this course will
introduced via examples during the lessons. These examples and example
solutions to the exercises, made during this course, will be published in a git
repository on github: <https://github.com/asoete/howest-webtechnology-code>.

This course is a very practical course. Making exercises and exploring/fiddling
with code is the best way to learn and get acquainted with all the aspects
featured in this course.

### Additional resources

An in depth guide/reference/manual for PHP can be found at <http://php.net>
