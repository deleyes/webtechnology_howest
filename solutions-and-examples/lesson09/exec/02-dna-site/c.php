   <p>
   Cytosine (/ˈsaɪtəˌsiːn, -ˌziːn, -ˌsɪn/;C) is one of the four main bases
   found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in
   RNA). It is a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and
   two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at
   position 2). The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine. In Watson-Crick base
   pairing, it forms three(3) hydrogen bonds with guanine.
